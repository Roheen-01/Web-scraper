# Web-scraper
This Python script is designed to perform web scraping with multithreading, focusing on gathering and analyzing website content for potential malicious links. It leverages the requests library to fetch web pages, BeautifulSoup from the bs4 module for HTML parsing, and Python's threading module to enable concurrent scraping of multiple websites.
